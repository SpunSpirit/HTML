    <h2 class="w3-wide">About Us</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify"> I have little coding experience, so it was difficult for me to understand some wording for things, and it was a lot of trial and error for things. However, I had a lot of fun in this class and knew I could reach out for help. It was only due to personal circumstances that I couldnâ€™t at times.
      From this class I was able to gain some experience with HTML and was shown how much more work I need to put into learning how to organize my workspace and my code. I had gone to office hours once and was given so much help immediately, but it showed me how I needed to set up my visual studio code. It also showed me how I need to organize my code better. Especially since I kept losing where I was visually sometimes when we kept building upon the code the further, we got. I really enjoyed it when we started doing CSS since it was interesting that you were able to give things classes and the manipulate the classes later on and have it affected everything later on without me having to change them individually.
